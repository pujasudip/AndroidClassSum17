The `Model` class captures what we refer to as a \"model\" or as a \"network\". Using Subclassing, we can create a class for our model, and then define the forward pass through the network using the `call` function.

Now that we have a sense of how `GradientTape` can be used to compute and access derivatives, we will look at an example where we use automatic differentiation and SGD to find the minimum of $L=(x-x_f)^2$. Here $x_f$ is a variable for a desired value we are trying to optimize for; $L$ represents a loss that we are trying to  minimize. While we can clearly solve this problem analytically ($x_{min}=x_f$), considering how we can compute this using `GradientTape` sets us up nicely for future labs where we use gradient descent to optimize entire neural network losses."
